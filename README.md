## Lab 3 Caesar Cipher Encryption, an MVC design Pattern
### Description 
This lab assignement was to create a ceasar ciphear encryption engine in the language java. The Caesar Cipher, one of the earliest forms of encryption, employs a simple yet effective method of securing messages. It operates by employing an encryption key and an input message, which is shifted a specified number of steps, as determined by the encryption engine. Notably, this encryption method accommodates both positive and negative shift values, making it a versatile and foundational technique in the realm of data security. The programme follows a classical Move Controller View. Invalid input was placed in a seperate class. As placing invalid input in any of other places would violate atleast one GRASP pattern. In this situation, when the 'Information Expert' does not provide an optimal solution, we can introduce a pure fabrication/indirection class. This approach improves the overall cohesiveness and reduces coupling within our system. High cohesion and low coupling help our system follow the separation of concerns principle thus making it more robust.
